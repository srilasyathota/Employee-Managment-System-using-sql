# Employee-Managment-System-using-sql
The Employment Management System is a relational database project developed using MySQL to efficiently manage employee-related data within an organization. The system centralizes employee information including personal details, job roles, departments, salary structures, payroll records, leave management, and qualifications into a structured database. It ensures data integrity using primary and foreign key constraints and supports business analysis through SQL queries such as joins, aggregate functions, and group-based reports. This project demonstrates strong understanding of database design, normalization, and real-world HR data management.
